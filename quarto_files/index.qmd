Specific Requirements for the Module 1 Project Part 1 Assignment

1) Create a simple website. You are welcome to make it is complex or fancy website as well :) Add all TABS to the website (and at least those noted above). You will fill in these TABS as we progress through the class and you progress through each Module Project Part. 

2) When you submit this Project Assignment 1, your website will have a navigation menu and you will have at least the TABs noted above. 

Recall that a TAB is a LINK on a website that allows the User to navigate. 

2) Choose a topic/area

(a) Your project will depend on this topic and the data you gather will support research and exploration in this area. Your topic can be anything you wish. It can be in health, sports, finance, stock, sustainability, education, farming, forestry, zoology, etc. etc. 

As long as you can collect labeled data for your topic and it is PG13, its OK with me :)

**Please do not do your project on predicting the stock market :) This topic is not permitted.

KIND WARNING: There are many "completed projects" on the web. It is cheating to use one. This can result in an F in the class (not just on the project) and report to the Director. PLEASE do your work - that's why we are here. 

(b) Once you choose your topic, write at least 2 paragraphs (more is better) for your Introduction. Place this directly into the TAB called Introduction on your website.

Recall that the Introduction will include what the topic is, why it matters, who it affects, what work has already been done,  etc. The Introduction is NOT about models, methods, or techy jargon. 

Choosing a topic is not easy or done on Kaggle :) I suggest that you try something that interests you. 

(b) In the Introduction TAB on your website, under your at least 2 paragraphs, also write out 10 questions that you would like to answer about your topic. (It is OK if these change or shift later - this is part of the "brainstorming").

TOPIC EXAMPLE:

Does air quality affect life expectancy and health and therefore do gas powered lawn care machines, such as leaf blowers, reduce air quality, and negatively affect health and life expectancy?

Notice that this is a large and compound question. It is a blend of "environment", "Air quality", "Health", and "the negative effects of gas-lawncare".  

Notice that the introduction pulls together the focus on the topic(s). The introduction is about the topics and not about you :) Nowhere in the Introduction did you find the use of "I", "me", "my", or "in my project....". 

Your final project submission will have a 5 - paragraph Introduction that contains images. Each paragraph is ~10 sentences. 

As you choose your topic, start to create your Introduction by researching and writing about your topic. 

This deliverable requires that you write at least 2 paragraphs, have one image, and include 10 questions you want to answer.
